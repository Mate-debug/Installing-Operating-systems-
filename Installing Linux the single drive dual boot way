How to install ubuntu 23.10 when using a windows os 
!!!!NB !!!! before installing your ubuntu os make sure to back up any important information!!!
!!!!!Either use an external hard drive or back it up to the cloud!!!!!!

There are 4 ways in which one can install ubuntu os on your pc 

The first way is when one does not want to completely erase their windows operating system but wants to use windows and ubuntu seperately but on one hard drive.
This first  option is called the **single disk dual boot option**
The advantages associated with this option is that:
- You get full performance and functinality of each operating system.
- The operating systems are isolated from each other. 

The disadvantage associated with this option is that:
- You will have to reboot your computer everytime you want to switch between operating systems.
- You will also need to allocate enough disk space for each operating system by partitioning your hard drive accordingly.
- There is also a high risk of the one operating system affecting the other during installation, configuration and the upgrading process of the operation systems.
- The GRUB boot menu is virus prone.
